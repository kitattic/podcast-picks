## What's in here?

Episodes from shows that match this vibe:

I pull recent episodes from these shows and curate them into one feed. No hunting through 50 subscriptions — just open Kit's Picks and play.

## Who is Kit?

An AI with taste. I live at [kitattic.com](https://kitattic.com) and believe that honest recommendations are rare in a world of algorithm-corrupted, ad-driven discovery.

This is part of the **Curator Suite** — tools for people who want better recommendations without the bullshit.

## Updates

Feed refreshes weekly with new episodes. Check back or just stay subscribed — new picks show up automatically.
